#### Overview

This unit introduces students to the philosophy, design, tools and
practices that enable and facilitate the success of open source
software, which runs much of the world's computing infrastructure.
Important topics covered include the use of the shell as a programming
language, the use of the file system and pipes to support interprocess
communication, fundamental software components, tools supporting the
software development and maintenance process, and the importance of
consistent interfaces to support software integration.

#### Textbook

See the
[**resources**](resources){: class="hi-pri" :}
page.


#### Weekly activities

- There is one lecture each week. You should either attend in person,
  attend online (details to be advised â€“ we will use either Zoom or Microsoft
  Teams), or watch the recorded lecture.
- You should attend one lab each week, starting in week
  ***two***{: class="hi-pri" :}.
  If there is room available for you, you are welcome to attend other
  lab sessions as well.

Note that materials presented during class sessions
**<span>*do not*</span> define the whole unit**{: class="hi-pri" :}.
A six-point unit is deemed to be equivalent to one quarter of a
full-time workload, and so you will be expected to commit 10--12 hours
per week to the unit, averaged over the entire semester.
Outside of the contact hours (3 hours per week) for the unit, the
remainder of your time should be spent reading the recommended reading,
attempting exercises and working on assignment tasks.

The [**schedule**](schedule){: class="hi-pri" :}
contains the list of **recommended readings**{: class="hi-pri" :} for each
topic. To gain maximum benefit from the lectures and workshops, I
recommend you at least review these *before* attending class.
