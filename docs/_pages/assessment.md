### Quiz ({{ site.data.globals.q1marks }}%) {#quiz}

There will be an online quiz in {{ site.data.globals.q1date }}.

Details are as follows:

- The quiz will be accessible by logging into UWA's
  [**LMS**][lms]{: target="_blank" class="hi-pri" :} (Learning Management System),
  accessing the CITS2003/CITS4407 content,
  and selecting "Week 3 quiz". (Be aware that, for reasons LMS admins
  seem unable to explain, CITS4407 content is listed under
  the LMS as CITS2003 content.)
- The quiz will be available on the LMS from **9am Tuesday 9th April**{:
  class="hi-pri" :} until **5pm Friday 12th April**{: class="hi-pri" :}.   
  But ensure you leave at least 1-2 hours available in which to complete
  the quiz. If you wait until after 3pm Friday 12th to start the quiz,
  and don't complete it, you will be awarded 0 marks.   
  The quiz will need to be completed in one sitting, and students are
  allowed one attempt at it.  
- The questions will be either multiple choice or short answer.   
  The quiz is open-book; you can make use of any book, website or
  software you like.  
  Questions may be drawn from any content contained in lectures, lecture
  slides, lab/workshop exercises or assigned readings up until the end
  of week 2 (i.e. the week commencing Monday 8 March), or may require
  you to make reasonable inferences from that material or to investigate
  questions arising from that material.   
- Ensure you have a good Internet connection when sitting the quiz --
  you should sit it either on a UWA lab computer, or at home,
  but not using WiFi or a mobile device, as these could drop out
  part-way through.   
  If you use a  WiFi or mobile connection and it fails, you won't be
  given extra time to complete the quiz.  
  If for some reason you can't access the quiz on the LMS, email me
  immediately from your University email account with a screenshot or
  photo showing the problem.
